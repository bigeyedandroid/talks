**Amiya Adwitiya**:     00:00          Hi, so my talk is about how to SRE without an SRE on your team. So we're basically going to look at SRE as a function more than a job or a title, right? So how can you look at SRE as a process that everyone adopts. For those of us who don't know, I guess most of us do. SRE is Site Reliability Engineering. I'm **Amiya Adwitiya**, I'm the founder of Squad Cast, which is a reliability orchestration platform. You can check us out on squadcast.com. So let me start by telling you what the stock is not, it's not going to tell you what SRE is or why it's important. Problems that it can solve or what a day in the life looks like. What it is, is actually a very easy getting started guide on, you know if you have no idea about what SRE is, how we can get started about it.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     00:53          So the first thing to do is, you know you need to understand that it's an evolution of your current process. So the first thing to understand is what are the metrics that you're monitoring and what are the important ones. So those important metrics can become your SLIs and SLOs. And I'll come to that a bit later. So once you understand what your most important metrics are, the next thing to do is understand what affects those metrics. So, you know, set some rules for the system, have an incident response process, and the third thing to do is, you know, document everything carefully. Now choosing your important metrics, it's good to work back from your business objectives. So understand what are the metrics that actually affects user experience. And you know, like for example, for user facing system, it could be latency, availability and volume. So some things to keep in mind while you choose your SLIs. It should be a metric that's under your control. It cannot be an external metric.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     01:51          And yeah, of course it's better to have fewer SLOs when you start with, you know, a maximum of three or four SLOs. The second thing is of course, having a framework to understand what affects these metrics. So having some rules for how your system behaves, how mitigation takes place, and setting up an incident response process is you know, the next step of kind of adopting SRE. The third thing is you know, documenting everything. So document every failure and fix. So of course you need to learn from your mistakes and your incidents and you can't do that unless you know, you're doing postmortems. Postmortems is just an easy way to start documenting everything.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     02:41          So just to get started with postmortems, it's easy to just pick one of the common templates and to start using that. And next thing I wanted to share some best practices that teams have. So best practices, just to caveat this you know, people have their own best practices but might not work for you. So don't just like blindly copy something that somebody else has as a best practice. Otherwise, you'll be in the situation of Brian here who's like "60% of the time. It works every time". But yeah, so some of the best practices that you know, we've learned other teams have is you know, do not push a production on Fridays because mostly Saturdays are not working. After push make sure you hang around to you know, check that it worked. And you know, customer facing teams should be aware of you know, what limitations your system has so that you know, they know what to promise and what not to. Some things to keep in mind is you know, don't give in to stress.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     03:41          On-call can be very stressful and you know, sometimes resolving an incident can take days. We all know this and you know, the easy way is to kind of help yourself is find some really good tools that take some of the load off of you and find avenues of automation. So what are those tasks that you find yourself repeating again and again and again and things that are simple and that can be, you know, just automated away, right? Don't burn out, you know, balance your workload. It's a lot of people come close to, you know, getting really frustrated while being on call and doing SRE. So the important thing to remember is chill out, you got this. If you've done,

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     04:24          if you have your SLIs and SLOs in place, you know you got your metrics and your goals and you have a process for response and everything has been documented, then at the end of the day you'll come out better you know, you'll be more reliable. So some useful resources out here, but you need to understand that SRE is a journey. It's important to learn from others, but at the same time, take everything with a pinch of salt because you know what works for other companies might not work for you. So understand the core logic behind you know, why people do things a certain way and then apply that logic to your situation and figure it out you know, how that might work.

**Amiya Adwitiya**:     05:01          Yeah, that's about it at. You can email me at squadcast.com maybe a couple lines about Squad Cast. We are building a platform to take SRE to organizations of every size. So help teams adopt the core principles of SRE and doing that by evolving their own existing practices.
